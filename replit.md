# Frontier Road — Community OS + Bounty Platform

---

## Hackathon Track Qualifications

### Tracks We Clearly Qualify For

---

#### 1. 🧠 Agentic Funding & Coordination: Frontier Tower Agent — $500 (PERFECT FIT)
**Sponsor:** Frontier Tower · **Prize:** $500 USD + runner-up: 1-year membership

This track literally describes what Frontier Road is. Frontier Tower is a 16-floor SF innovation hub that wanted an agent residents actually talk to — one that surfaces needs, routes bounties, and helps coordinate the building.

| Challenge Problem | What We Built |
|---|---|
| Conversational agent residents talk to | Tower AI (GPT-4o, SSE streaming, 10 live tools) |
| Cross-floor resource matching | Skill-based resident search + `find_residents_by_skill` tool |
| Bounty routing + autonomous allocation | Full bounty marketplace with USDC escrow, claim/complete flow |
| Floor issue reporting | `report_floor_issue` Tower tool → creates MAINTENANCE bounty |
| Governance interface | Treasury page with real transaction ledger + floor allocation tracking |
| Live picture of what's happening | Dashboard with per-floor resident/issue indicators + system log |
| Onboarding new members | Auto-created resident profile on first login, complete-profile banner |

**Submission strength:** Every bullet point in the challenge description maps to a shipped feature.

---

#### 2. 🧠 Agentic Funding & Coordination (Solana) — $1,200 (STRONG FIT)
**Sponsor:** Solana · **Prize:** $1,200 winner / $800 runner-up

The track wants agents that *take action* — vote on proposals, move funds, evaluate work, pay for services. Tower does all of this on Solana devnet.

| Requirement | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Agents that take action (not just dashboards) | Tower executes real SOL transfers on devnet via `execute_solana_transfer` |
| Move funds programmatically | Bounty escrow: USDC rewards locked/released on claim/complete; SOL payouts from Tower wallet |
| Coordinate resources between agents and humans | 10 Tower tools: bounties, residents, treasury, floor issues, wallet queries |
| Preferred stack: Solana + agentic frameworks | `@solana/web3.js`, devnet wallet `BG2YdWeTMYFHNxkUBtTemrSuqHpwL5MqG27qF85jtHVp`, 0.5 SOL funded |
| Explain reasoning | Tower streams reasoning via SSE with inline tool-call status indicators |

**What stands out:** Tower's `execute_solana_transfer` tool signs and broadcasts a *real* on-chain transaction, saves the tx signature to the DB ledger, and streams the result back — not a simulation.

---

#### 3. 🌐 Sovereign Infrastructure by Bittensor — $1,500 (MODERATE FIT)
**Sponsor:** Bittensor · **Prize:** $1,500 new project / $1,000 meaningful advancement

**Requirement:** "Must touch some part of the Bittensor stack."

| Requirement | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Touch Bittensor stack | TAO wallet via `@polkadot/keyring` (sr25519 keypair); balance query via taostats.io REST API; Bittensor AI inference via Chutes.ai (Subnet 64) |
| Agent identity without centralized registry | Tower's Bittensor wallet (`5Fxx8eF9eay7EzJF463of5UfR8eWoaVaVuFjxFs6JDc1yTtV`) is an sr25519 keypair derived from a BIP39 mnemonic — no OAuth, no login, cryptographically sovereign |
| Something meaningful works without a trusted third party | `query_bittensor_subnet` tool routes inference to Bittensor Subnet 64 (Chutes.ai) — if OpenAI is rate-limited or censors content, this path is independent |
| Threat model | Centralized AI providers (OpenAI) can throttle, censor, or shut down. Frontier Road's Bittensor integration provides a decentralized inference fallback and a TAO-denominated payment rail for community bounties |

**Honest limitations:** Main Tower logic still runs on OpenAI (gpt-4o). The Bittensor integration is a real but partial sovereignty layer — not a fully decentralized system. Submit as "meaningful advancement" framing or a hybrid architecture story.

---

### Tracks We Could Enter With Additional Work

---

#### 4. 🧠 Agentic Funding & Coordination: Metaplex Onchain Agent — $5,000 (HIGH VALUE)
**Sponsor:** Metaplex · **Prize:** $5,000 USD

**Base requirement:** Register Tower as an agent on the Metaplex Agent Registry (gives Tower an onchain Solana identity + x402-compatible API for receiving crypto payments).

What we'd need to add:
- Register Tower's Solana wallet (`BG2YdWeTMYFHNxkUBtTemrSuqHpwL5MqG27qF85jtHVp`) via Metaplex Agent Docs
- Expose Tower's bounty/concierge endpoint as an x402-payable HTTP API
- Optional: launch a community token via Tower's agent wallet

This is realistic work (1–3 hours) and the prize is $5,000. Highest ROI of all tracks if pursued.

---

#### 5. 🖥️ BONUS: The ElevenLabs Voice Challenge (POSSIBLE)
**Sponsor:** ElevenLabs · **Prize:** 3–6 months Pro per team member

Add voice to Tower AI: user speaks to Tower, Tower speaks back using ElevenLabs TTS. Tower's streaming SSE architecture already supports real-time output — adding voice would be a natural fit for the "agent that feels alive" criterion.

---

#### 6. 🌸 BONUS: Made by Human by human.tech — $1,200 (POSSIBLE)
**Sponsor:** human.tech · **Prize:** $1,200 (new project)

Requires registering at `frontier.human.tech` and integrating Human Passport (sybil-resistant identity). Frontier Road already has auth and resident identity — adding Passport as a verification layer for bounty participants would qualify. Community coordination + public goods funding aligns with their Covenant principles.

### Tracks That Don't Fit

| Track | Why Not |
|---|---|
| 🤖 Physical AI & Robotics (NomadicML) | Requires real hardware: robots, drones, embedded systems |
| 🤖 Physical AI: Data at Scale (Deep Lake) | Must use Deep Lake GPU-native database as core data layer |
| 🧠 Meteora Challenge | DeFi LP strategy on Solana AMM pools — different domain |
| 🧠 Unbrowse Challenge | Must use Unbrowse as the data/action layer |
| 🧠 Arkhai Agentic Commerce | Must integrate Alkahest conditional escrow contracts (EVM/EAS) |
| 🧠 Lit Protocol Challenge | Must use Lit's signing, encryption, and TEE compute |
| 🛡️ AI Safety & Evaluation | Red-teaming / evaluation harnesses — different domain |
| 🛡️ Kalibr Resilience Challenge | Requires Kalibr SDK instrumentation (2-line add, but marginal fit) |
| 🌐 Sovereign Infra: Bittensor Subnet Design | Requires full subnet spec: miners, validators, incentive mechanism design |

---

### Recommended Submission Strategy

**Submit to all three strong tracks** — they're not mutually exclusive:
1. **Frontier Tower Agent** — tell the building story; this is the most human/narrative track
2. **Agentic Funding & Coordination (Solana)** — emphasize on-chain action: real SOL transfers, escrow mechanics, Tower as economic agent
3. **Sovereign Infrastructure (Bittensor)** — lead with the sr25519 wallet identity + Subnet 64 AI gateway + TAO payment rail; be honest about current limitations

**Pursue Metaplex if time allows** — $5,000 prize, and registration is a few API calls on top of what already exists.

## Tower AI Tool Calling

Tower AI has access to 10 tools that query/mutate the live database, Solana blockchain, and Bittensor network:
- **list_bounties(status?, category?, floor?)** — Search bounties with filters
- **find_residents_by_skill(skill)** — Find residents by skill keyword match
- **get_residents_by_floor(floor)** — List all residents on a floor
- **get_treasury_status()** — Live treasury balance, escrow, payouts
- **report_floor_issue(floor, location, description, urgency?)** — Creates MAINTENANCE bounty
- **get_wallet_balance(wallet_address)** — Queries any Solana wallet's SOL balance on devnet in real time
- **execute_solana_transfer(recipient_wallet, amount_sol, reason)** — Signs and broadcasts a real SOL transfer from Tower's devnet wallet; saves tx signature to DB ledger
- **get_tao_balance(wallet_address)** — Queries any Bittensor wallet's TAO balance via taostats.io API; pass "tower" for Tower's own wallet
- **execute_tao_transfer(recipient_wallet, amount_tao, reason)** — Records a TAO payout from Tower's Bittensor wallet; saves to DB ledger (on-chain broadcast needs funded wallet)
- **query_bittensor_subnet(prompt)** — Sends prompt to Bittensor subnet 18 via Corcel API; returns decentralized AI response

Each request includes a live context snapshot (open bounty count, treasury balance, resident count, recent transactions) injected into the system prompt. Tool call results stream back via SSE with inline status indicators.

## Solana Integration Details

- **Tower wallet**: `BG2YdWeTMYFHNxkUBtTemrSuqHpwL5MqG27qF85jtHVp` (Solana devnet)
- **Lib**: `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/solana.ts` — connection, keypair loading, `getSolBalance()`, `transferSol()`, explorer URL helpers
- **Route**: `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/solana.ts` — `GET /api/solana/tower-wallet`
- **Frontend hook**: `useTowerWallet()` in `artifacts/frontier-road/src/hooks/use-treasury.ts` — polls every 30s
- **Treasury page panel**: shows network badge, live SOL balance, full address, Solana Explorer link, and a "Request Devnet SOL" button (client-side browser fetch to bypass server IP rate limits)
- **Transfer cap**: 1 SOL max per transaction on devnet (safety guard)
- **On-chain payouts are recorded**: tx signature saved to the `transactions` table with `type="payout"` and `token="SOL"`

## Bittensor Integration Details

- **Tower TAO wallet**: `5Fxx8eF9eay7EzJF463of5UfR8eWoaVaVuFjxFs6JDc1yTtV` (Bittensor Finney mainnet)
- **Wallet library**: `@polkadot/keyring` + `@polkadot/util-crypto` — sr25519 keypair, SS58 encoding (same as Substrate/Polkadot)
- **Balance API**: taostats.io REST API (`GET /api/account/?address=<ss58>`) — free, no key needed
- **Lib**: `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/bittensor.ts` — `getTaoBalance()`, `getTowerPair()`, `queryBittensorSubnet()`, explorer URL helpers
- **Route**: `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/bittensor.ts` — `GET /api/bittensor/tower-wallet`
- **Frontend hook**: `useBittensorWallet()` in `artifacts/frontier-road/src/hooks/use-treasury.ts` — polls every 60s
- **Treasury page panel**: shows TAO balance (free + staked), address, Taostats Explorer link, testnet faucet link, and AI subnet online/offline indicator
- **Bittensor AI**: provider-agnostic OpenAI-compatible gateway; set `BITTENSOR_AI_BASE_URL` + `BITTENSOR_AI_KEY` to activate. Active options: nineteen.ai (`https://api.nineteen.ai/v1`), Targon (`https://targon.sybil.com/api/v1`), chutes.ai (`https://llm.chutes.ai/v1`)
- **Transfer cap**: 0.5 TAO max per transaction (safety guard)
- **TAO payouts are recorded**: saved to `transactions` table with `type="payout"` and `token="TAO"`

## Auth, Profile, Security & Wallet

- Auth uses Replit OIDC via `@workspace/replit-auth-web` → `useAuth()` hook
- On first login, a resident profile is auto-created using the user's name and avatar
- The sidebar user area (avatar + name + RESIDENT) links to `/profile`
- A "COMPLETE YOUR PROFILE" banner shows on the dashboard if skills or bio are missing
- Existing seed residents can be claimed via `POST /api/me/link-resident/:residentId`
- When authenticated, the wallet identity is automatically set to `user_{id}` — no separate "Connect Wallet" step needed
- The CONNECT_WALLET button in the header is hidden when the user is authenticated
- Unauthenticated users can still manually connect a demo wallet
- **Route protection**: All mutation endpoints (POST/PATCH) require authentication via `requireAuth` middleware (returns 401 JSON)
- **Server-enforced identity**: `creatorWallet` and `claimerWallet` are set server-side from `req.user.id` — client-supplied values are ignored
- **Ownership checks**: Cancel requires `creatorWallet === req.user.id`; Complete requires `claimerWallet === req.user.id` (403 otherwise)
- **Atomic state transitions**: Bounty claim/complete/cancel use `WHERE status = ...` guards to prevent race conditions
- **Rate limiting**: express-rate-limit per-user: 5 bounty creates/hr, 10 claims/hr, 30 AI messages/10min (429 JSON on exceed)
- **Security headers**: helmet.js on all responses (CSP disabled for compatibility)
- **Frontend error handling**: Global MutationCache catches 401→redirect to login, 403→permission denied toast, 429→rate limit toast
